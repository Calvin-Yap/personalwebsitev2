# About The Project

An updated version of my personal portfolio

This project improves from the previous by:

- Being mobile friendly, the last version was only able to be displayed on XL devices
- Has my updated projects and resume
- Simpifies from my previous approach where I was still learning web development fundamentals and trying to do too much

## Built With

- HTML/SCSS
- jQuery
- Firebase Hosting

## Language Choices

- Was familiar with vanilla JS and wanted to try out using jQuery
- Hosted using Firebase as I am familiar with it and for its simplicity in collecting user counts and crash analytics
